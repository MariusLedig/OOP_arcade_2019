Documentation Arcade


Arcade is a gaming platform: a program that lets the user choose a game to play and keeps a register of player scores. To be able to deal with the elements of your gaming plate-form at run-time, graphic libraries and games are implemented as dynamic libraries, loaded at run-time.
Each GUI available for the program must be used as a shared library that will be loaded and used dynamically by the mainprogram.
The architecture is this.
    •  A Core class orchetrate all the logic of dynamic libraries, run-time changes, ...
    •  A IGame represent the game.
    •  A IGraphic represent an graphic library.
